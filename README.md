# GoDynamoDB
DynamoORM for go, just for fun because I don't know go now.

## install
This repo is maintained by `godep`, so you should just install `godep` by `go get github.com/tools/godep` , and than you can enjoy this repo:

```shell
go get github.com/Misfit-John/GoDynamodb
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Misfit-John/GoDynamodb
godep restore
```

And yes, I don't sure about this install process now because I haven't tried it yetðŸ‘»

#### dependency:
Only `aws/aws-sdk-go` is necessary third party dependency, other packages are all official packages.

## supported tag
**DAlias** the alia name of the field which will finally show in db.

**DPKey** mark this field as the partition key of table/index, the value should be the name of the table/index.

**DRKey** mark this field as the range key of table/index, the value should be the name of the table/index.

## Reference
Some of the encoder and decoder codes is copied from github.com/justonia/dynamodb-helpers, great thanks for justonia, that repo saves my time.

## known limit:
- if you wanna decode this field, your field must be exportable, which means the field's name should start with capital letter. This limitation is from golang's export strategy , I have no idea with it.
- if there is a field named "Test", and you set an alias as "test" to it, then you shouldn't use "test" as field name in your struct, otherwise it will get error when doing encode/decode.
- DPKey and DRKey should use the table/index's name
- table name can't be same as index name
- Will sleep 100ms or more if the request for BatchGetItem is too large to return in one time.
- Don't allow duplicate keys in batch get request because the limit of AWS SDK
- This ORM won't handle expression name map for you automatically because I don't sure what do you mean by `table.second.thrid` . Is it a field named `table.second.thrid` or a path to embedded JSON document?
- If the partition key is appear , then we think this is a global index, otherwise we think it is a local index

## update log
- 2016/06/25 `0.0.1-Alpha` released !Almost all frequently use APIs are all implemented. This package can work now. I will add more test case on it so it won't get problem
